# GMOD Script Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of **Lua scripts** developed for Garry's Mod's **Starfall** environment, focusing on **custom gameplay systems**, **targeting algorithms**, **camera control**, and **advanced ACF ballistics simulation**. These scripts were originally developed for personal use and have since been refined and released to support the wider GMod modding community.

Each project demonstrates practical scripting implementations and techniques for enhancing realism, automation, and immersion within Garry's Mod, particularly in ACF-based combat scenarios and sandbox gameplay.
