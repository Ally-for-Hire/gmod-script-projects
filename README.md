# Starfall Projects Portfolio

A curated portfolio of Starfall Lua systems built for Garry's Mod. The projects in this repository highlight how I approach real-time scripting challenges, plus interface, automation, and simulation work, inside a constrained game environment. Each folder captures a different slice of my development practice, from UX-heavy HUDs to combat logic, control theory, and reusable utility libraries.

## Highlights
- Demonstrated ability to design, document, and ship production-ready Starfall components
- Experience translating gameplay requirements into modular Lua architectures
- Focus on clarity, maintainability, and in-game performance under sandbox constraints
- Proven track record supporting multiplayer teams with reliable tooling and automation

## Skills in Practice
- **Systems design:** event-driven scripting, state machines, robust error handling
- **Gameplay programming:** targeting logic, ballistics approximations, vehicle control
- **Interface design:** responsive HUDs, data visualization, workflow-focused UI
- **Simulation & analytics:** telemetry logging, diagnostics overlays, decision support
- **Collaboration:** consistent naming, inline docs, and versioned releases for teammates

## Project Categories
- `huds_and_displays` - Player-facing HUDs, diagnostics panels, and visualization tooling
- `firing_computers` - Fire-control systems, targeting solutions, and weapon management logic
- `mobility_controllers` - Navigation aides, drive systems, and stabilization control loops
- `information_systems` - Sensor fusion, alerting, and command-information utilities
- `public_lib` - Shared helper modules that enforce consistent patterns across projects

Each directory contains released Starfall chips ready to drop into a Garry's Mod world. Many include configuration tables so teams can adapt behavior without modifying code.

## Working with the Projects
1. Place the desired `.txt` file inside `garrysmod/data/starfall/` (already mirrored in this repository).
2. Load it through a Starfall chip in-game and tweak any exposed variables or config tables.
3. Review in-file documentation for wiring diagrams, dependencies, or suggested component pairings.

I am happy to walk through setup, customization, or broader workflow questions, just reach out.

## Let's Connect
I am always open to feedback, collaboration, or commissions. If you are exploring Starfall, building GMod tooling, or hiring for scripting roles, I would love to talk.
